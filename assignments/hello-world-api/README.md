# Homework Assignment #1: Hello World API

## Details:

Please create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 

2. When someone sends an HTTP request to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want.

## Video Component:

Make a screencast showing off the code you wrote for this assignment. Walk us through your file(s), line by line, explaining what the code means and why you wrote it the way you did. Then, execute your code from your terminal and show off the required functionality. You can use Postman, Curl, Wget or any other HTTP client you like to perform the actual HTTP requests. If you're comfortable doing so, please narrate as you go and explain what you're showing us.
